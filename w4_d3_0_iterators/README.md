# Interview Prep - Iterators

Today you'll be implementing iterator functions on the whiteboard in groups of three. Since there are three problems, each group member should take a turn "driving" for one problem with the other two as support ("navigators").

**Note:** DO NOT use any built-in iterator functions from Underscore or another library. You will often be asked in interviews to implement well-known methods like this from scratch as problem-solving exercises.

## Problems

1. Write a function called `each` that takes in an array and a callback function. `each` should iterate through all items in the array and call the callback function with each item and its index as parameters. `each` should return the original array that was passed in.

2. Write a function called `map` that takes in an array and a callback function. `map` should iterate through all items in the array, call the callback function with each item and its index as parameters, and return a new array of the results.

3. Write a function called reduce that takes in an array of numbers. `reduce` should return the sum of all the numbers in the array.

## How to Get Started

* Use pseudo-code to diagram the input and output of your function before writing any code on the board.
* Come up with at least three examples of test input, and write down the expected output. **Hint:** For `each` and `map`, one of your test inputs will be a function.
* Only when you have pseudo-code and test input with expected output should you write code to implement the body of the function.
