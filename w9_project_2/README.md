## WDI SECOND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
For the second project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or others online. The type of web application you create is your choice: utilities, social networks, games, mashups, etc. Ensure, however, that the scope of your project is not too large so that you can reasonably complete an [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) in the allotted time. 

The objective of this project is to:

* Work with a group in a shared GitHub repository, and contribute code to a project which you do not own.
* Plan and implement a larger scale project as part of a development team.
* Integrate topics learned and experience gained in the course so far.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.

You will be working in **groups of 3-4** for this project.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

* **Postgres** Use [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com) for your database in development and production.
* **Models** Your app should have at least 3 models with appropriate associations and validations.


* **Testing** All custom model methods should have test specs, and some controllers and/or views should also have specs. Fewer than 10 tests total will reflect very negatively on your overall assessment. Start writing tests early, or you will struggle to get them done. 


* **Validation** Your application should validate incoming data before entering it into the database.
* **Error Handling** Forms in your application should also validate data, handle incorrect inputs, and provide  on the client side.
* **Views.** Use **partials** heavily to follow DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) development in your views.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have authentication and authorization set up.
* **Home and About pages** - Don't forget to work on a proper homepage, clearly explaining what your app is and will do. Create an about page with photos to show off your team. 
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.
* **User Experience** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. It is suggested to use a front-end CSS framework like Bootstrap to enhance and ease your CSS styling. 
* **JavaScript & jQuery.** Spice up the front-end of your app and have some event driven functionality. Try out a new plugin or a library.
* **Responsive Design** Make sure your app looks decent on a phone or tablet.

## Stretch Goals



## OTHER IDEAS
We may not have covered all of these in class, but if you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app.

* **External APIs.** Use an external API to add functionality to your app.
* **AJAX.** Use AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading the page when appropriate.
* **File upload** Take a look at [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) or [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) using [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for file hosting.
* **Web Scraping** Check out [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/), [mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize), and [phantom.js](http://phantomjs.org/).
* **Regex** You might consider using Regular Expressions to process text. Validation is one common use case. Use [Rubular](http://rubular.com/) for initial testing.
* **Charting** Visualize your data with [Morris.js](http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/) or [D3](http://d3js.org/).
* **Job Scheduling** Find a way to include Sidekiq (or Delayed Job or Resque) to your project.

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES


####Project Plan deliverables:
*You should review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.*

* **Group members.** You'll be working in groups of 3-4. Use your strengths to contribute to all parts of the project.
* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User stories.** What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in [Trello](https://trello.com).
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out whatyour core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations (ERD) for your project.
* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for your group based on how you prefer to work.
