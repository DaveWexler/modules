# Preparation "Lab"

There are 3 parts to tonight's homework/lab. They're designed to prepare you for tomorrow. 

1. Read the [intro to Ruby OOP readings](https://github.com/sf-wdi-19-20/homework/blob/master/week6/01-ruby-oop.md).

1. Read the [intro to Rails readings](http://ajbraus.gitbooks.io/wdi-evening-readings/content/week6/01-intro-to-rails.html).

1. Install Rails: type `gem install rails` into your terminal from any directory.  Use the [homework submission form](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/14rNXnDaq5X5Rvda-1BRZCl9YmkOoZzf7oxGBEZG_YJE/viewform) comments field to either (1) tell us that it went fine or (2) copy and paste the error message you received.

If you'd like, you can also continue on challenges from today.
