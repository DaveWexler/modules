### Analogy (What?)



### Key Take Aways & Key Snippets

#### User Narratives - Example from Coride.com

> Hi I'm Dan the Driver, I'm driving from Madison to Chicago, so I put in my trip with a total price of $20 and a pickup point of 2 o'clock at the dutch mill park and ride. I immediately see that there are some people I could pick up in Madison and some in Janesville. I contact the people from Madison first because I'd get the whole fair that way. if they don't work out I'll contact the Janesville people.
