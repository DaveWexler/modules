# Evening Activities

Wednesday, August 5, 2015

Tomorrow we'll cap our Rails projects with three important but smaller topics: the asset pipeline, partials, and testing.  

Tonight, you'll have pre-reading on each topic to help you prepare!

## Asset Pipeline

The [asset pipeline](http://ajbraus.gitbooks.io/wdi-homework/content/asset-pipeline.html) helps us use track and manage assets (including css and js files) in our Rails projects.

## Partials

[Partials](http://ajbraus.gitbooks.io/wdi-homework/content/partials.html) let us reuse view code! Woohoo!  

## Testing

[Testing](https://github.com/ajbraus/wdi-homework/blob/master/rails-testing.md) LITERALLY saves lives... or, for our apps, keeps users happy. :)

## Submission

Please submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/1zSklHtCYKg_NhkLdjlQaCXFrHJQ4Io266cKUs9_Dg8I/viewform) after you are done for the evening!
