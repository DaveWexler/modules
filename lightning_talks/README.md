# Lightning Talks!

**What:** Prepare a **5-minute lightning talk** about a tool or technology we haven't covered in class. This can be a topic you choose to independently research, something you want to incorporate into your final project, or something you've already used or know about.

## Requirements

### Goal

This is a chance to apply the skills you've learned in WDI to learn about new technology, or to share your existing knowledge of a technology with your classmates. Your lightning talk should get your classmates excited about your topic.

### Content

For your new tool or tech, answer:

* What is it?
* Why is it awesome?
* How do people use it?
* Where is it going?

Your talk doesn't have to be in that order.

### Structure

* Your lightning talk **MUST be 5 minutes or shorter**.
* Your lightning talk should include 3-10 slides (or screens), but don't read off of the slides. :)

### Suggestions

Get creative and play with your tech. You're not required to build a demo (and you probably wouldn't have enough time to present it!), but try out tech instead of just reading about it.
