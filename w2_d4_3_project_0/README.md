## Summary

Imagine you want to let people write really short public blog posts. The homepage of your app should be a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one.

## Basic Requirements

| Concepts | Tools | Objects |
| :------: | :---: | :-----: |
| User Stories, OOP | Underscore, Bootstrap, jQuery, Git, Kanman Board | Post |

1. Make your basic user narrative, object list, and Kanman board.
2. Start by creating a basic project and push to a public repo. Make frequent commits and pushes (every hour or so). Include a very, VERY short README.md that outlines what your app does and the libraries you are using.
3. Make your initial layout. Use default Bootstrap classes with minimal custom CSS.
4. Make a list of `posts` using Underscore.js tempting and jQuery (and OOP!).
5. Make a form to add new `posts` to the list using Underscore.js tempting and jQuery.
6. Be sure to comment your code; make the code clean (mind spacing and indentation).

## Stretch Challenges (optional)

* Add a count of how many posts have been posted that updates every time a new post is created
* Add a bootstrap JS component like a tooltip
* Add more custom CSS to make it very beautiful :)
* Add `Model` object that saves `posts` to `localStorage`.
* Add a `comments` on `posts`.
