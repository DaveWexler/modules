# Readings on Rails

Homework for tonight has 3 parts:

1. Read [7 Things I Wish I Knew About Rails](http://ajbraus.gitbooks.io/wdi-homework/content/65-what-i-wish-i-knew.html)

1. Explore [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/). Make sure you're looking at the guides that match the version of Rails you have installed. (Check your Rails version from the terminal with `rails -v`.) Skim over one or two of the guides - the ones in the Controllers section are a good place to start.  You should reference Rails Guides as you learn Rails.

1. Continue with your own experimentation/practice/review.

When you have finished the reading, submit the [Reading Homework Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zSklHtCYKg_NhkLdjlQaCXFrHJQ4Io266cKUs9_Dg8I/viewform).
