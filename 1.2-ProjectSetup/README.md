###Basic Terminal Challenges

1. Check the path to the directory you are in
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. Create a directory called 'dev' in the root of your computer
4. Inside 'dev' Make a directory called `blogtastic`
5. Make a file called `index.html`
6. Make a file called `app.js`
7. Make file called `style.css`
8. Make a folder called `images`
5. Open the `blogtastic` folder in Sublime (if you do not already have sublime's terminal command installed follow [these instructions](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html))
8. List the files in your blogtastic directory
6. Install "tree" - `$ brew install tree`
7. Call tree on your `blogtastic` directory. Pretty nice . . . : )
9. Initialize a github repository in your `blogtstic` directory
10. Create a github repo called **blogtastic**
11. Add, commit, and push your `blogtastic` files to your new blogtastic repo
12. Change
