#How to Pair Program

###1. Plan Roles

Come up with a clear and defined goal that is reachable within 1-2 hours.

####Driver:
* Actively interprets navigators logic into code.
* Is typing and moving the mouse.
* DOESN'T PASSIVELY TYPE.

####Navigator:
* Is analyzing and thinking through next steps
* Drives high level logic (solving the problem with pseudo code)...Nicely.
* Helps guide the driver with coding.

Once roles are defined, time for each roles should be discussed, switch roles around after 30 minutes.

###2. Do's and Don'ts

Be vocal with each other about what's going on:
* what's being typed
* why it's being typed
* TRUST each other (mistakes that either of you won't catch --> proofreading, syntax errors, style [indentations, coding conventions, etc.])

###3. Check-In

* Sync up with each other frequently.  It is very easy for a pair to fall out of sync.  
* Be actively engaged with each other and what task is being accomplished       at the moment.
* Don't be afraid to say NO!.....or yes!

###4. Celebrate

* Celebrate the victories.... Mandatory HIGH FIVES!.... or hugs, or cheers, or thumbs way way up :D
* Celebrate the failures as well.  They can lead to breakthroughs.

###5. Remember to Switch

* DON'T forget to switch roles!!!!! and Smile.
