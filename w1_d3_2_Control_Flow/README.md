##Objectives  
| Objectives |
| :--- |
| Trace the flow of a program based on its code |
| Predict the output from `if/else` and `switch` statements |
| explain the differences between `for` loops and `while` loops, and when to use each |
| implement `if/else` logic, `for` and `while` loops, and combinations |

### Motivation (Why?)

Conditionals and loops are fundamental to all programming in every language and paradigm.

### Examples/Demo (How?)

if/else
```
var a = true
if (a) {
  console.log("awesome!")
} else {
  console.log("a is not true :(")
}
```

for
```
var m = ["Bill", "Nicki", "Kelly"]
for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  console.log(m[i] + " is a nice person")
}

```

while
```
while (i < 10) {
    console.log("The number is " + i);
    i++;
}
```

### Basic Challenges
1. In a snippet inside of developer tools create a variable that is an array of 5 strings. Loop over the array and log it to the console if its length is 4 or longer.
2. Create an array of 3 hashes with 2 key:value pairs: name and age. Write a conditional for loop that logs to the console only the name of the oldest person.
