## Sum Pairs

Write a function to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value. Can you implement it in constant (`O(n)`) time?

## Collatz Conjucture

Start with a number `n > 1`. Find the number of steps it takes to reach `n = 1` using the following process:

```js
// if n is even, divide it by 2
// if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
```

## Addition Land

Implement multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and subtraction (`-`) using only the addition (`+`) operator.

## Number to Words

Given an integer between 0 and 999,999, print an English phrase that describes the integer (e.g., "One Thousand, Two Hundred and Thirty Four").
