# Week 7 Weekend Lab: Straight Rails Blog

Here's what rails is made for! Make a straight up blog.

## Requirements

1. Don't copy and paste or clone code. Start with `rails new <app name>`
2. Full CRUD on Posts and Comments
3. Authentication - only make posts and comments if logged in

## Recommendations

1. Remember to follow **Route-Side-In** - start with the routes, then controllers, then templates, then models.
2. Pay attention to error messages closely - they are your best helpers!
3. Work together and help each other.

## Stretch Options

Add some stretches.

1. add tags (many-to-many)
2. Use will_paginate for pagination
5. Make pretty URLs with Stringex or friendly-id
3. a character counter on comments
6. Implement HAML for your views
4. Implement a payment gateway with the stripe gem
5. Use HTTParty to consume an external API
6. Integrate with slack with slack-notify
2. image upload with Paperclip
4. Submit your posts or comments through ajax
6. Parse dates with Chronic
7. Implement an 'undo' functionality with Paranoid
