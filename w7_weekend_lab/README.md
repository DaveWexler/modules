## Requirements

1. Full CRUD on Posts and Comments

5. Make pretty URLs with Stringex or friendly-id
3. a character counter on comments
6. Implement HAML for your views

5. Use HTTParty to consume an external API
6. Integrate with slack with slack-notify
2. image upload with Paperclip
4. Submit your posts or comments through ajax
