## Challenges (& Tonight's Homework)

Make a music search app using jQuery, AJAX, and the Spotify API.

### Requirements

1. Your app must have a form to search for songs.
2. When a user submits the form, use jQuery to save the form data to a variable.
3. Once you have the form data, use AJAX to make a call to the Spotify API.
4. Parse the data you received from Spotify, and use jQuery and Underscore templating to render that data on the page.

### How to Get Started

1. Create a new directory and GitHub repo called `spotify_app`.
2. You'll need `index.html` and `script.js` files. Feel free to copy the starter code to get started.
3. Song title and artist name.
4. Submit the link to your `spotify_app` repo in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/14rNXnDaq5X5Rvda-1BRZCl9YmkOoZzf7oxGBEZG_YJE/viewform" target="_blank">homework submission form</a>.

### Stretch Challenges / Bonus

1. Album artwork, play preview
2. Allow the user to search by `album` or `artist` in addition to `track`
