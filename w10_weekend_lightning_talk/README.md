# Lightning Talks!

This weekend, prepare a lightning talk about a new tool or technology.

## Requirements

### Goal

Your lightning talk should get your classmates excited about your topic. 

### Content

For your new tool or tech, answer:

* What is it?
* Why is it awesome?
* How do people use it?
* Where is it going?

Your talk doesn't have to be in that order. 

### Structure

* Your lightning talk MUST be shorter than 5 minutes long.  
* Your lightning talk must include 3-10 slides (or screens), but don't read off of the slides. :)


### Suggestions

Get creative and play with your tech.  You're not required to build a demo (and you probably wouldn't have enough time to present it!), but try out tech instead of just reading about it.
