#How to Pair Program

###Step One (Planning):

Come up with a clear and defined goal that is reachable within 1-2 hours.

Define Roles: 

 --> Driver: Actively interprets navigators logic into code.
         --> DON'T PASSIVELY TYPE. 
 --> Navigator: Director. Drives high level logic (solving the problem with pseudo code)...Nicely.
         --> Helps guide the driver with coding. 

--> Once roles are defined, time for each roles should be discuessed, switch roles around 30 minutes.

###Step Two (How):

Be vocal with each other about what's going on:
    --> what's being typed
    --> why it's being typed
    --> TRUST each other (mistakes that either of you won't catch --> proofreading, syntax errors, style [indetations, coding conventions, etc.])

###Step Three (Check-In):

Sync up with each other frequently. 
Be actively engaged with each other and what task is being accomplished at the moment.
Don't be afraid to say NO!..... or yes!

###Step Four (Celebration):

Celebrate the victories.... Mandatory HIGH FIVES!.... or HUGS.

###Step Five (Switch):

DON'T forget to switch roles!!!!! and Smile.
