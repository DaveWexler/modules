You're going to have a lot of questions . . . A lot. So here's what you should do when you can't figure something out and you want help:

##25 min total -> READ - GOOGLE - ASK

###1. Read the Relevant Documentation - 5-10 min

All code bases, frameworks, and languages have official and unofficial documentation for every method inside them as well as on "Getting Started." You should read a lot of this. Advanced developers read a lot of documentation and continually reference the documentation of the tools they use.

###2. Google Your Question or Topic - 5-10 min

Say you have a question about how to serve an express template from a route and an express controller in node.

	Bad Google:     "How do you find a template in express"
			     "What do I do to get my templates in express through my routes"

	Good Google:   "Express template routing how to"
			      "Getting started express routing templates"

	Say you are making your first rails app and don't know where to begin

	Bad Google:    "new rails"
			    "new rails app"
			    "How to initiate a new rails app"

	Good Google:  "getting started rails tutorial"
